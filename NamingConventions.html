<h1 style="text-align: center">Naming Conventions</h1> <br>
<p class="slightlyBig">Naming conventions make programs more understandable by making them easier to read.
They can also give information about the function of the identifier—for example, whether it’s a
constant, package, or class—which can be helpful in understanding the code.<br>
The conventions given in this section are high level. Further conventions are given at (to be
determined)</p>

<tr>
<td>Classes</td>
<td>Class names should be nouns, in mixed case
with the first letter of each internal word capitalized.
Try to keep your class names simple
and descriptive. Use whole words—avoid
acronyms and abbreviations (unless the abbreviation
is much more widely used than the
long form, such as URL or HTML).</td>
<td>class Raster;<br>
class ImageSprite;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Interfaces</td>
<td>Interface names should be capitalized like
class names.</td>
<td>interface AirCar;<br>
interface Storing;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Methods</td>
<td>Methods should be verbs, in mixed case with
the first letter lowercase, with the first letter of
each internal word capitalized.</td>
<td>run();<br>
runFast();<br>
getBackground();</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Variables</td>
<td>Except for variables, all instance, class, and
class constants are in mixed case with a lowercase
first letter. Internal words start with capital
letters.<br>
Variable names should be short yet meaningful.
The choice of a variable name should be
mnemonic— that is, designed to indicate to the
casual observer the intent of its use. One-character
variable names should be avoided except
for temporary “throwaway” variables. Common
names for temporary variables are i, j, k,
m, and n for integers; c, d, and e for characters.</td>
<td>int &nbsp;&nbsp;i;<br>
char &nbsp;&nbsp;*cp;<br>
float &nbsp;&nbsp;myWidth;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Constants</td>
<td>The names of variables declared class constants
and of ANSI constants should be all
uppercase with words separated by underscores
(“_”). (ANSI constants should be
avoided, for ease of debugging.)</td>
<td>int MIN_WIDTH = 4;<br>
int MAX_WIDTH = 999;<br>
int GET_THE_CPU = 1;</td>
